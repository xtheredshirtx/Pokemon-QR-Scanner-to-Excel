# Pokemon-QR-Scanner-to-Excel
This Python script scans QR codes in real-time using a webcam, logging unique codes to an Excel file. It uses OpenCV and PyZbar for scanning, and Openpyxl for data logging. Duplication is avoided and scanning events are logged in a .log file. Press 'q' to stop the script.
